    "This is the installation guide to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install an IDE that is capable of compiling executing Python code. The IDE here is Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "2. Install Tensorflow and other required packages such as Keras to develop and execute machine learning and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation guide is heavily inspired by the one created by Dr Heaton, who is currently an adjunct instructor for the Sever Institute at Washington University. The link to the original guide from Dr Jeff Heaton is as follows: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-jul-2020.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the IDE\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the first is to install the latest version of Python and its IDE. There are two mainstream Python distributions: one is Miniconda, which is a minimal installer that only includes conda, Python, and other essential packages. The other is Anaconda, which is an 'ultimate' installer that includes over 1,500 other packages. As quoted by the original document [Anaconda vs Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda):\n",
    "\n",
    "|Anaconda | Miniconda |\n",
    "| :------------ | :-------------- |\n",
    "| Choose Anaconda if you:  | Choose Miniconda if you:  |\n",
    "| 1. Are new to conda or Python. | 1. Do not mind installing each of the packages you want to use individually.| \n",
    "| 2. Like the convenience of having Python and over 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed at once. | 2. Do not have time or disk space to install over 1,500 packages at once. | \n",
    "| 3. Have the time and disk space --- a few minutes and 3 GB. | 3. Want fast access to Python and the conda commands and you wish to sort out the other programs later. |\n",
    "| 4. Do not want to individually install each of the packages you want to use. | | \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many other data scientists and instructors, I strongly recommended using the Miniconda because you can install the most frequently used packages on your own while discarding the rest if you use Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Miniconda** is as follows: [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The link to download **Anaconda** is as follows: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",
    "\n",
    "After the download is finished, open the installer and follow the instructions to install Miniconda. Then, open the Miniconda command prompt with administrator privileges and install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -y jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "The following steps to install Tensorflow and other necessary dependencies are both applicable for **Anaconda** and **Miniconda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Tensorflow\n",
    "1. After the Jupyter Notebook is installed, we will install Tensorflow for deep learning. To do so, we firstly create an Anaconda environment. Here, I created an environment called **tensorflow** to hold the Python v3.7 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name tensorflow python=3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: it is important to check which version of Python is compatible with the newest version of Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To enter this environment, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate tensorflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: whenever you start working on your Tensorflow project in Windows, **remember to activate the Anaconda command prompt environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, add Jupyter support to the new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install nb_conda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With all the important pieces are in place, we then install Tensorflow. Here, we will only install the version that supports CPU and GPU. If you want to use GPU for Tensorflow, check to see whether you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU: [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). Use the following command to install the GPU-supported Tensorflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we will register the environment using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow --display-name \"Python 3.7 (tensorflow)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: please make sure your _tensorflow_ environment **is activated before using this command**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. (Optional), you can use the following command to resolve any dependency failure/conflict or to update dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update --all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install additional libraries:\n",
    "1. Use the following command to install the required packages that are included in the file `tools.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env update --file tools.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Note: As of June 2020, the latest version of Keras is v2.4.0, and it is only compatible to Python v3.8 or lower. Thus, please make sure you have a compatible version of Python before installing Keras. Additionally, please make sure your **tensorflow** environment is activated before using this command.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Test the environment:\n",
    "1. We can now start the Jupyter notebook by using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can also run the following code to check that whether we have the versions expected."
